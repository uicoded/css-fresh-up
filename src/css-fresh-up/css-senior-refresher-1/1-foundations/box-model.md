# Box Model

Boxes have different behavior based on their `display` value, their set dimensions, and the content they contain. This content could be plain text, or more boxes generated by child elements. Either way, the content affects the size of the box by default.

You can control this using **extrinsic sizing**, or you can use **intrinsic sizing** to let the browser make decisions for you based on the content size.

Everything in CSS has a box around it, and understanding these boxes is key to being able to create more complex layouts with CSS, or to align items with other items.

- Block and inline elements
- The different boxes that make up an element and how to style them — content, margin, border, padding.
- The alternative box model (accessed via `box-sizing: border-box`) and how it differs from the regular box model.
- Margin collapsing.
- Basic display values and how they affect box behavior — `block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, `none`.

### Outer
